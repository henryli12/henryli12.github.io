					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I first came into contact with coding when I was a sophomore in high school. I was placed into a web-design
						class without any idea of what it was. I thought it would be just as simple as using a website builder platform
						to design a website, but it turned out I had to learn to build a website using HTML and CSS. At the time,
						coding did not appeal to me at all and I did not really want to learn about coding. It was not until college that 
						I was truly exposed to computer science. I was taking a web-design course again in my freshman year, but I did not expect
						much from that class and thought it would be easy since I have already taken a similar class in high school.
						However, I learned that computer science is not just about using HTML and CSS. From that class, I also
						learned about PHP and JavaScript. I was surprised at how versatile computer science can be. As a result, 
						I decided to take more computer science courses and became a Computer Science major.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a Computer Science Degree, I hope to become a Software Enginner. I want to become a Software Engineer 
						because I enjoy solving real-life problems with programming. I like to create software that is life-changing 
						and can make our daily life easier. An example of such software I have created is my Random Restaurant 
						Generator, which randomly selects a restaurant when I don't know where to get food. Although this problem 
						is pretty insignificant to most people, it is a good starting point to what I want to do. Becoming a Software 
						Engineer would allow me to solve larger and more important problems.
